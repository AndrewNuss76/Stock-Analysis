# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The intent of this analysis was to evaluate performance of multiple stocks from different years years in an automated and repeatable fashion. While we could easily use excel to conduct this analysis, the benefit of using VBA allows for reduce potential in human error and reduces the memory and space of the file. By creating this code, we're able to easily review performance from different years, and could reuse this code at a different time to do the same analysis.

## Results
First you will see performance of the stocks and overall code for 2017 below:

Second, the results for 2018 are as followed:

## Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date
For this specific question, we simply wanted to identify if there was a trend on which month was the most successful for starting campaigns. For this analysis, it was fairly simple as we took the outcomes from the different campaigns, and plotted them by month. Based on the image below, you can see the overall trend:
